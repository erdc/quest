Quest Design
============

Quest has several (sometimes conflicting) design goals. The current design aims
for a practical balance between these goals.

Architectural Goals:
  - Cross platform: OS X, Windows, Linux
  - Needs to be easily extendable.

API Goals:
  - The api should be optimized to allow ease of scripting and interactive in python
  - The api should allow for use as a backend library to drive web and gui interfaces

Data Goals:
  - Downloaded data should be reasonably structured, portable and usable even if you don't use Quest later
  - Should allow reasonable tracking of provenance and transformations of data
  - Provide mechanisms to publish/share data that has been downloaded/transformed
  - Easily publish structured data as user defined services


Core Concepts
-------------
Refer to :doc:`../core_concepts`.

Settings
--------

Quest can be configured in three ways:

  1. Setting Environmental Variables
  2. Passing in a python dictionary to quest.api.update_settings()
  3. Reading a yaml file with quest.api.update_settings_from_file()

Any settings that are not set explicitly are given default values

Description of Settings:

========================= ======================================================================= ====================================
Variable Name             Description                                                             Default
------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
QUEST_BASE_DIR            Base directory to save quest data/metadata                              determined by appdirs python package
QUEST_CACHE_DIR           Location to save cached data/metadata                                   QUEST_BASE_DIR/cache/
QUEST_PROJECT_FILE        Name of project metadata file                                           quest_project.yml
QUEST_PROJECTS_INDEX_FILE Name of projects index file listing available projects and their paths  quest_projects_index.yml
QUEST_CONFIG_FILE         Name of quest_config file that these settings are saved in              quest_config.yml
QUEST_USER_SERVICES       list of web/file uris to user defined Quest services                    None
========================= ======================================================================= ====================================

You can add any extra settings needed by a plugin here as well using the keyword:arg structure.




Projects and Collections:
  - A project is a folder that has some metadata and a set of collections
  - All collections in a project are saved in subdirectories of the main project folder for portability
  - Only one project can be active at a time, if none is specified a project called 'default' will be created and used
  - Other projects can be opened as 'local' web services and features/data 'downloaded' in to the current project
  - Only one dataset (with linear progression of versions) can exist in a (collection,parameter,feature) tuple. i.e. You cannot have two temperature datasets like 2015 Temperature and 2013 Temperature in the same collection+feature. You will either need to copy the feature with a new feature_id or copy to a new collection.
  - Any 'project' can be added as a user defined Quest service (either from a local/network drive or http folder). In that case, the 'project' is equivalent to a 'provider' and each 'collection' is equivalent to a 'service'
  - There will be a way to convert folders of non Quest data into a user defined service by adding a quest_project.yml to the folder with appropriate metadata. These will be read-only projects.


Services:
  - There will be three types of services available (use the service_type filter in quest.api.get_service() to return a specific list)
        - geo-discrete: These are what we currently use, feature based, features have location info
        - geo-seamless: This is for seamless datasets. There is no get_features function. Instead you pass a geometric feature (bbox, line etc) to the service and the data is extracted and returned (eg. GEBCO Global Bathymetry data)
        - geo-typical: This had features, by the features do not have geometry defined. Will function the same as geo-discrete. Will need to add a tag based search option.

Parameters:
  - external_name: what it is called in the service
  - external_vocabulary: what the external vocab is
  - vdatum: vertical datum if relevant
  - long_name: display name
  - standard_name: quest name, i.e air_temperature:daily:max
  - vocabulary: ERDC Environmental Simulator
  - units: m
  - concept: air_temperature
  - frequency: hourly, daily, etc
  - statistic: instantaneous, mean, min, max etc

Example Directory Structure::

        cache/                              # data caches go here
        quest_config.yml                      # quest configuration settings
        quest_projects_index.yml              # list of active projects & their paths. projects do not need to be in this directory
        myproject_1/                        # example project called myproject_1
            quest_project.yml                 # project metadata
            mycollection_1/                 # example collection inside myproject_1
                quest.yml                     # collection metadata
                features.h5                 # master list of features inside collection, can also be csv, geojson
                parameters.yml              # file to keep track of available parameters, download status, versions of downloaded data etc
                temperature/                # folder for all temperature data in mycollection_1
                    feature_1/              #   folder for temperature data at feature_1 (feature_1 coords & metadata are in the master features.h5)
                        66a4e39d            #       temperature datasets at feature_1
                        f974a0c1            #       these are different versions of the same dataset, the last one is the final
                        203a91e3            #       the versioning and applied filters metadata is tracked in quest_collection.yml
